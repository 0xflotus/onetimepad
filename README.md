One Time Pad - Python
=======================

* It is a Python script coded just for fun.
* Crypt executable takes an input of the message to be crypted, and a KEY; and returns a cipher text in hexadecimal.
* Decrypt executable takes an input of the cipher text to be decrypted, and the KEY; and returns the original message.

--------------------------
**Note:** 

1. The crypted message is easy to crack as the length of key is not compulsorily equal to the length of message.
2. So **do not** use it for commercial purposes!
