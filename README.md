One Time Pad - Python
=======================

* Crypt executable takes an input of the message to be crypted, and a KEY; and returns a cipher text in hexadecimal.
* Decrypt executable takes an input of the cipher text to be decrypted, and the KEY; and returns the original message.

--------------------------
**Note:** 

1. The crypted message is easy to crack **if** the length of key is less than the length of message.
2. Thus, it is advised not to use it for storing real private stuff. This is
just a hack!
