One Time Pad - PYTHON
=======================

* It is a Python script coded just for fun.
* Crypt executable takes an input of the message to be crypted, and a KEY; and returns a cipher text in hexadecimal.
* Decrypt executable takes an input of the cipher text to be decrypted, and the KEY; and returns the original message.

* The crypted message is easy to crack as the length of key is not compulsorily equal to the length of message. 
* So don't use it for commercial purposes!
