One Time Pad - PYTHON

//The crypted message is easy to crack. Don't use it for commercial purposes :P!

You are free to use the code in any way you want! :)

It is a Python script coded just for fun.
Crypt executable takes an input of the message to be crypted, and a KEY; and returns a cipher text.
Decrypt executable takes an input of the cipher text to be decrypted, and the KEY; and returns the original message.

Note: The Python files will directly execute in ubuntu (also other Linux distros possibly), to use on other Operating Systems, you need to have Python interpreter installed.
